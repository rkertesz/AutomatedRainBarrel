AutomatedRainbarrel
===================

Open source internet connected rainbarrel to improve stormwater control and reduce water consumption

Overview:

The automated rainbarrel project is designed to determine how quickly open-source collaborative efforts can result in a functioning, intelligent, "internet of things" product that can serve both people and the environment. This is part of an independent research project and the results (specifically documentation on who is contributing and how it takes shape) will be presented at a conference on water resources in June of 2014. 

Details:

The current repository has some logical diagramming, hardware specifications, and open-source software. It is expected to change and multiple contributors are welcome.

Rationale:

Rainwater is both an asset and a curse. Sometimes there's too much. Sometimes there isn't enough. This project is intended to be a collaborative effort to design and program rainbarrels and other vessels to store water when it rains, making it available for irrigation when it's dry.

The primary purpose is to provide homeowners with the water they need to irrigate (e.g. lawns, gardens) or use for non-potable purposes. It is designed to alert the homeowner when it hasn't rained for some time. It can automatically irrigate, and it is designed to allow connectivity with other sensors (e.g. ground moisture sensors or an on-site weather station). 

The second objective is to prepare the rainbarrel for an oncoming storm by emptying it beforehand. In stormwater control, the concept of Low Impact Development (LID), is to mitigate rainfall-runoff close to the source. Roofs are one of the largest producers of directly connected runoff from single family homes. Rainbarrels are generally full or near full before a storm, particularly in areas with rainy wet seasons. This doesn't do anything to reduce urban runoff or "shave" the peak of the storm. If the rainbarrel is intelligent enough to prepare itself for an oncoming rainstorm, then it will make the correct volume available to mitigate runoff.

Impounding rainwater on your property may not be legal in every municipality. Check with your local water management district or utility before installing a rainbarrel.
